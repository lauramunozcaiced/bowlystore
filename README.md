# Bowly Store
Bowly Store is a bowls sales portfolio project made by Laura Mu√±oz in the course of Layout and Animation css by Platzi. 

I wanted to take advantage that this was an easy course for me, to do something creative and with more weight, while still practicing JS and implementing animations.

This project is native with Javascript, it tries to simulate the process of purchase and delivery of a product.
